        It must be objectively clear that an error was made during grading. Examples of such errors include a grader incorrectly
        summing points or incorrectly marking something not completed. Grades based on the judgement of the grader, except in
        extremely extenuating circumstances, will not be regraded. In particular, grades for categories like "Site is Visually
        Appealing" will not be regraded. All regrade requests must be submitted though the Google form provided on Piazza within
        one week of grading. Requests submitted after this deadline will not be considered. Requests must contain a specific
        explanation of the error, including filenames and line numbers of code, if appropriate.</p>
